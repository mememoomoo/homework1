        <p class="bio">Born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah I accidently found my career as a web developer after I was asked to start a Web Development department at a small loan company.
            From there I started freelancing on Upwork and slowly built my portfolio until I was able to shift to full time Web Design and Development. I continue to love what I do and look forward to building more.
            When I'm not working at home I enjoy games. All kinds of games. Card games, board games, table top games, video games. You name it, I love it.
